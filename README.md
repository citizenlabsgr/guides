# Guides
We are developing a Jekyll template for quickly building out project pages, guides, and documentation. Similar guides and page template systems have been created by [18F](https://pages.18f.gov/guides-template/) and others. As a learning tool this project will work from the ground up to create a system for Citizen Labs.
